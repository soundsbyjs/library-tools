Media library tools for my homelab jellyfin server

# What is this?

These are scripts and tools I'm using to keep my library tidy. 

That includes FFMPEG scripts that reduce the size of large video files

Some handy python scripts to compress bluray audio so my neighbors don't get mad

Youtube Downloader scripts that run things in parallel (for mass downloading)

All of this amounts to a library that is more equipped to serve high quality content to my friends and family!
